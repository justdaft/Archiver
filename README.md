# Archiver Project

## PowerShell, WPF and XAML

This project is as a result of being asked at work to create a PowerShell script to copy some files from a users machine to an on site and off site file store, the results of this archiving had to be written to an excel spreadsheet for auditing.

The script had to have a UI, so I created this using WPF and XAML.

This project is currently on going so please excuse the roughness of it all.

The scripts and UI are all fully working but I still have a few things on my todo list for it.

This is a screenshot of the main window.

Stay tuned for more in the coming days
